    <h4> airbnb</h4>
        <p>A collaboration on building a Airbnb price suggestor app</p>

    <h4>APP FUNCTIONALITY DESCRIPTION</h4>
        <p>For our Unit Project, we were handed the task of developing an app that uses a predictive model trained on historical booking data from Airbnb
        to predict optimal pricing for a person's properties. Airbnb Price Suggestor will allow a user to predict the trends for optimal pricing for their
        properties based on variables such as location, rooms and other features. The user will be able to manage multiple properties at different
        locations and be able to make adjustments to their expectations for booking, as well as what they should be charging.</p>

    <h4>THE DATA</h4>
        <p>The dataset for this project was used from the Kaggle NYC Airbnb 2019 datasets.

    <h4>SOLUTION DESCRIPTION</h4>
        <p>In order to be able to utilize this dataset, we used a random forest model in order to suggest the optimal price of a property based on the given features.
        Our app was built using Flask as its development framework for the front end and SQLAlchemy for handling the database end.</p>

    <h4>RUNNING OUR APP LOCALLY</h4>
        <p>Pull the repo into your local machine using git clone.</p>
        <p>Change directory into your Airbnb_Price_Suggester directory</p>
        <p>Run set/export FLASK_APP=airbnb_predict</p>
        <p>Run flask run</p>
